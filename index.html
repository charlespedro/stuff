	<p>How effective is aid? Much has been written about the economic failures of Latin America in the 1970s and in Africa throughout the 1980s and 90s. Despite massive amounts of aid, many countries failed to achieve economic growth or quality of life improvements.</p>

	<p>This project tries to measure the effectiveness of aid by looking at how much countries have received compared to a few development indicators.</p>
